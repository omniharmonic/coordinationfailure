/**
 * Chat scope validation — shared between LobbyDO and GameRoomDO.
 *
 * A relay envelope with `type: 'messaging'` carries a `scope` that may be:
 *   - 'all'                 → broadcast to every participant
 *   - 'team'                → sender's team only
 *   - <player display name> → directed message ('dm')
 *
 * Games declare which kinds they support via `CoordinationGame.chatScopes`.
 * 'all' is always accepted regardless — every game has an implicit
 * everyone-broadcast channel. If 'team' isn't in the list, a team-scoped
 * message is rejected; same for 'dm'.
